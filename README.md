### Greetings, Fellow developers! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated programmer deeply immersed in the art of low-level programming, binary exploitation, and the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. 
As I pursue my studies at ğŸŒ± 1337 Coding School ğŸŒ±, I bring a diverse perspective shaped by my bachelor's degree in management. With a penchant for C programming, I enjoy diving into the depths of code to unravel its secrets. ğŸ”­
