### Greetings, Fellow developers! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dedicated programmer deeply interested in the art of low-level programming, binary exploitation, and the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. 
As I pursue my studies at ðŸŒ± 1337 Coding School ðŸŒ±, I bring a diverse perspective shaped by my bachelor's degree in management. With a penchant for C programming, I enjoy diving into the depths of code to unravel its secrets. ðŸ”­

- âš¡ **Iâ€™m currently working on the Core Curriculum of 1337 School**
